#### Definition

*Our channels* means *all communications channels, spaces, locations, meetings, events, activities, and media items which are governed by our [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md).*

#### Notes

Our channels may include entire systems and platforms which we directly govern.  However, our channels may also include systems which include some differently-governed channels.  Therefore, *our channels* functions as the root governance primitive.
